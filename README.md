# Video experiment

This experiment reads the MediaStream from your webcam and copies it to multiple canvases, resulting in a kaleidoscopic effect.

See the [live example](https://abudaan.github.io/video-experiment/dist).

- click somewhere in the document
- now you can adjust the number of canvases with your arrow keys

I was inspired by this [sass plugin](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/placing-items-circle/) that was in its turn inspired by an solution Ana Tudor came up with on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle)
